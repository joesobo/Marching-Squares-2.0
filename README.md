[![Made with Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Unity-57b9d3.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity)](https://unity3d.com)

This is a tool that I am developing in the Unity Engine. It is built around the Marching Squares algorithm to enable users to quickly and efficiencly generate interesting and unique terrain.

This tool is currently under development, though you can check out [the old v1.0 here](https://github.com/joesobo/Marching-Squares).
